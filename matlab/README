INTRODUCTION:
---------------------------------------------------

SimpleCTC comes with a seperate MATLAB code
which is "ContourTreeConnectivity.m"

In order to run the code, you need to compile
SimpleCT.

If you have not done yet should should first run:

>> mex -setup

to setup your compiler for MATLAB.

After this, just run:

>> matlab_setup

If everything goes OK, this will compile SimpleCT
for you and run the 2 example scripts: 
"example_CT.m" and "example_CTC.m"
(The code is only tested in Ubuntu 12.04.)


---------------------------------------------------
EXAMPLE-1
---------------------------------------------------
"example_CT" demonstrates how SimpleCT can be
called to compute contou trees.

The executable comes with SimpleCT for MATLAB
interface is ContourTree. This can be called as:

% Computes and prunes the contour tree
>> [ct ct_img] = ContourTree(img,0.1,32);

% Plots the contour tree
>> ContourTreePlot(img, ct, ct_img);


---------------------------------------------------
EXAMPLE-2
---------------------------------------------------
"example_CTC" demonstrates how ctc can be computed
using the ContourTreeConnectivity function.

% If you need only the CTC value, just run:
(Input "img" must be LOGICAL type)
>> ctc = ContourTreeConnectivity(img);

If you want to specify pruning parameters, use:
>> ctc = ContourTreeConnectivity(img,0.1,32);

which will prune with intensity threshold 0.1, and
area/volume threshold 32.
