This is a simple example for SimpleCTC.

DEPENDENCIES:

- You need to have "cmake" to be able to use the install script.
- Eigenvalues are computed using "petsc" and "slepc".
- The code uses "OpenMP" for multicore computing of the
contour tree and the eigenvalues.


INSTALLATION:

Just run the "install" script as

$./install

This will create the executable
"simpleExample"


USAGE:

$./simpleExample test_128x128.binary 0.1 32


Description of arguments:

- First argument (test_128x128.binary) is the name 
of the input image file.

The format of the file name is important.

For "test_128x128.binary", "_128x128" indicates the size.
".binary" indicates the data format. ".binary" means a
binary image composed of 1s and 0s. The values are of
uint8 data type in the image.

The code supports 2D/3D images of types binary, uint8 
and uint16.

Example: example3D_128x128x128.uint16


- Second argument (0.1) is the intensity threshold
used in pruning

- Third argument (32) is the area/volume threshold
used in pruning
